# Proposal to Adopt as WG Documents

We the authors of [Blind BBS Signatures](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-kalos-bbs-blind-signatures-01.html) and [BBS per Verifier Linkability (pseudonyms)](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-vasilis-bbs-per-verifier-linkability-01.html) would like to call for their adoption as CFRG working group documents. These documents build on the core [BBS Signature Scheme](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-06.html) to provide important features necessary for privacy preserving digital credentials. Such privacy preserving digital credentials are being developed at the W3C [Data Integrity BBS Cryptosuites v1.0](https://w3c.github.io/vc-di-bbs/) (see section 4), and EUDI ARF see [cryptographer's feedback](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15904122/cryptographers-feedback.pdf) with regards to pseudonymous authentication and non-transferability ("anonymous" holder binding).

In addition, these drafts provide key features that can be used by higher level protocols that require anonymity and/or blind signature capabilities such as [privacy pass](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/privacypass/about/)

Best Regards

Greg and Vasilis
